0,Low dietary fiber promotes enteric expansion of a Crohn's disease-associated pathobiont independent of obesity.,"Obesity is associated with metabolic, immunological, and infectious disease comorbidities, including an increased risk of enteric infection and inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease (CD). Expansion of intestinal pathobionts such as adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) is a common dysbiotic feature of CD, which is amplified by prior use of oral antibiotics. Although high-fat, high-sugar diets are associated with dysbiotic expansion of E. coli, it is unknown if the content of fat or another dietary component in obesogenic diets is sufficient to promote AIEC expansion. Here, we found that administration of an antibiotic combined with feeding mice an obesogenic low fiber, high sucrose, high fat diet (HFD) that is typically used in rodent obesity studies promoted AIEC intestinal expansion. Even a short-term (i.e., 1-day) pulse of HFD feeding before infection was sufficient to promote AIEC expansion, indicating that the magnitude of obesity was not the main driver of AIEC expansion. Controlled diet experiments demonstrated that neither dietary fat nor sugar were the key determinants of AIEC colonization, but that lowering dietary fiber from approximately 13% to 5-6% was sufficient to promote intestinal expansion of AIEC when combined with antibiotics in mice. When combined with antibiotics, lowering fiber promoted AIEC intestinal expansion to a similar extent as widely used HFDs in mice. However, lowering dietary fiber was sufficient to promote AIEC intestinal expansion without affecting body mass. Our results show that low dietary fiber combined with oral antibiotics are environmental factors that promote expansion of Crohn's disease-associated pathobionts in the gut.",['10.1152/ajpendo.00134.2021 [doi]'],"['microbial colonization', 'influences', 'liver']"
1,Dietary fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids: A potential therapeutic target to alleviate obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Over the past several decades, increasing global prevalence of obesity-related nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been one of main challenges to human health. Recently, increasing evidence has validated connections among short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a physiologically relevant concentration, the intestinal microbiota, and host metabolism. In this review, we summarized crosstalk between SCFAs and host metabolism in relation to NAFLD pathophysiology, focusing on recent advances. Firstly, how SCFAs are generated and absorbed under different nutritional conditions in the gut. Secondly, how SCFAs maintain gut barrier and alleviate hepatic inflammatory responses. Thirdly, how SCFAs maintain hepatic energy balance through controlling appetite and mediating the glucose homeostasis at the systemic level. Fourthly, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) are widely involved in the above metabolic processes regulated by SCFAs. Overall, this review aimed to provide new insights into the prospects of SCFAs as a potential therapeutic target in management of liver diseases.",['10.1111/obr.13316 [doi]'],"['commensal microbiota', 'promoting', 'Inflammatory bowel disease']"
2,"Adipose Tissue Inflammation Is Directly Linked to Obesity-Induced Insulin Resistance, while Gut Dysbiosis and Mitochondrial Dysfunction Are Not Required.","Obesity is associated with adipose tissue hypertrophy, systemic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and intestinal dysbiosis. Rodent models of high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding or genetic deletion of multifunctional proteins involved in immunity and metabolism are often used to probe the etiology of obesity; however, these models make it difficult to divorce the effects of obesity, diet composition, or immunity on endocrine regulation of blood glucose. We, therefore, investigated the importance of adipose inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gut dysbiosis for obesity-induced insulin resistance using a spontaneously obese mouse model. We examined metabolic changes in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, the intestinal microbiome, and whole-body glucose control in spontaneously hyperphagic C57Bl/6J mice compared to lean littermates. A separate subset of lean and obese mice was subject to 8 weeks of obesogenic HFD feeding, or to pair feeding of a standard rodent diet. Hyperphagia, obesity, adipose inflammation, and insulin resistance were present in obese mice despite consuming a standard rodent diet, and these effects were blunted with caloric restriction. However, hyperphagic obese mice had normal mitochondrial respiratory function in all tissues tested and no discernable intestinal dysbiosis relative to lean littermates. In contrast, feeding mice an obesogenic HFD altered the composition of the gut microbiome, impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial bioenergetics, and promoted poor glucose control. These data show that adipose inflammation and redox stress occurred in all models of obesity, but gut dysbiosis and mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction are not always required for obesity-induced insulin resistance. Rather, changes in the intestinal microbiome and mitochondrial bioenergetics may reflect physiological consequences of HFD feeding.","['10.1093/function/zqaa013 [doi]', 'zqaa013 [pii]']","['high fat-diet', 'causes', 'weight gain']"
3,"Whole genome metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome of differently fed infants identifies differences in microbial composition and functional genes, including an absent CRISPR/Cas9 gene in the formula-fed cohort.","Background: Advancements in sequencing capabilities have enhanced the study of the human microbiome. There are limited studies focused on the gastro-intestinal (gut) microbiome of infants, particularly the impact of diet between breast-fed (BF) versus formula-fed (FF). It is unclear what effect, if any, early feeding has on short-term or long-term composition and function of the gut microbiome. Results: Using a shotgun metagenomics approach, differences in the gut microbiome between BF (n = 10) and FF (n = 5) infants were detected. A Jaccard distance principle coordinate analysis was able to cluster BF versus FF infants based on the presence or absence of species identified in their gut microbiome. Thirty-two genera were identified as statistically different in the gut microbiome sequenced between BF and FF infants. Furthermore, the computational workflow identified 371 bacterial genes that were statistically different between the BF and FF cohorts in abundance. Only seven genes were lower in abundance (or absent) in the FF cohort compared to the BF cohort, including CRISPR/Cas9; whereas, the remaining candidates, including autotransporter adhesins, were higher in abundance in the FF cohort compared to BF cohort. Conclusions: These studies demonstrated that FF infants have, at an early age, a significantly different gut microbiome with potential implications for function of the fecal microbiota. Interactions between the fecal microbiota and host hinted at here have been linked to numerous diseases. Determining whether these non-abundant or more abundant genes have biological consequence related to infant feeding may aid in understanding the adult gut microbiome, and the pathogenesis of obesity.",['10.1016/j.humic.2019.100057 [doi]'],"['gut microbiota', 'influences', 'diabetes']"
4,Oral Limonite Supplement Ameliorates Glucose Intolerance in Diabetic and Obese Mice.,"Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is a serious threat to public health worldwide. It causes a substantial economic burden, mental and physical disabilities, poor quality of life, and high mortality. Limonite is formed when iron-rich materials from the underground emerge and oxidized on the ground surface. It is currently used to purify contaminated water, absorption of irritant gases, and improve livestock breeding. Limonite can change the composition of environmental microbial communities. In the present study, we evaluated whether limonite can ameliorate glucose metabolism abnormalities by remodeling the gut microbiome. Methods: The investigation was performed using mouse models of streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus and high-calorie diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Results: Oral limonite supplement was associated with significant body weight recovery, reduced glycemia with improved insulin secretion, increased number of regulatory T cells, and abundant beneficial gut microbial populations in mice with diabetes mellitus compared to control. Similarly, mice with obesity fed with limonite supplements had significantly reduced body weight, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis, and systemic inflammatory response with significant gut microbiome remodeling. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that limonite supplement ameliorates abnormal glucose metabolism in diabetes mellitus and obesity. Gut microbiome remodeling, inhibition of inflammatory cytokines, and the host immune response regulation may explain the limonite's beneficial activity under pathological conditions in vivo.","['10.2147/JIR.S320451 [doi]', '320451 [pii]']","['dietry calcium', 'decreases', 'obesity']"
5,Interactions between the microbiota and enteric nervous system during gut-brain disorders.,"For the last 20 years, researchers have focused their intention on the impact of gut microbiota in healthy and pathological conditions. This year (2021), more than 25,000 articles can be retrieved from PubMed with the keywords ""gut microbiota and physiology"", showing the constant progress and impact of gut microbes in scientific life. As a result, numerous therapeutic perspectives have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota composition and/or bioactive factors released from microbes to restore our body functions. Currently, the gut is considered a primary site for the development of pathologies that modify brain functions such as neurodegenerative (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc.) and metabolic (type 2 diabetes, obesity, etc.) disorders. Deciphering the mode of interaction between microbiota and the brain is a real original option to prevent (and maybe treat in the future) the establishment of gut-brain pathologies. The objective of this review is to describe recent scientific elements that explore the communication between gut microbiota and the brain by focusing our interest on the enteric nervous system (ENS) as an intermediate partner. The ENS, which is known as the ""second brain"", could be under the direct or indirect influence of the gut microbiota and its released factors (short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, gaseous factors, etc.). Thus, in addition to their actions on tissue (adipose tissue, liver, brain, etc.), microbes can have an impact on local ENS activity. This potential modification of ENS function has global repercussions in the whole body via the gut-brain axis and represents a new therapeutic strategy.","['S0028-3908(21)00276-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108721 [doi]']","['low carb diet', 'reduces', 'Enterobacteriaceae']"
6,NOD1 in the interplay between microbiota and gastrointestinal immune adaptations.,"Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that detects bacterial peptidoglycan fragments and other danger signals, has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. NOD1, which is expressed by immune and non-immune cells, is activated after recognizing microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). This recognition triggers host defense responses and both immune memory and tolerance can also be achieved during these processes. Since the gut microbiota is currently considered a master regulator of human physiology central in health and disease and the intestine metabolizes a wide range of nutrients, drugs and hormones, it is a fact that dysbiosis can alter tissues and organs homeostasis. These systemic alterations occur in response to gastrointestinal immune adaptations that are not yet fully understood. Even if previous evidence confirms the connection between the microbiota, the immune system and metabolic disorders, much remains to be discovered about the contribution of NOD1 to low-grade inflammatory pathologies such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. This review compiles the most recent findings in this area, while providing a dynamic and practical framework with future approaches for research and clinical applications on targeting NOD1. This knowledge can help to rate the consequences of the disease and to stratify the patients for therapeutic interventions.","['S1043-6618(21)00359-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105775 [doi]']","['Trimethylamin-N-Oxid', 'cause', 'arrhythmia']"
7,Ligilactobacillus Salivarius LCK11 Prevents Obesity by Promoting PYY Secretion to Inhibit Appetite and Regulating Gut Microbiota in C57BL/6J Mice.,"SCOPE: Obesity is a common disease worldwide and there is an urgent need for strategies to preventing obesity. METHODS AND RESULTS: The anti-obesity effect and mechanism of Ligilactobacillus salivarius LCK11 (LCK11) is studied using a C57BL/6J male mouse model in which obesity is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Results show that LCK11 can prevent HFD-induced obesity, reflected as inhibited body weight gain, abdominal and liver fat accumulation and dyslipidemia. Analysis of its mechanism shows that on the one hand, LCK11 can inhibit food intake through significantly improving the transcriptional and translational levels of peptide YY (PYY) in the rectum, in addition to the eventual serum PYY level; this is attributed to the activation of the toll-like receptor 2/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway in enteroendocrine L cells by the peptidoglycan of LCK11. On the other hand, LCK11 supplementation effectively reduces the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and shifts the overall structure of the HFD-disrupted gut microbiota toward that of mice fed on a low-fat diet; this also contributes to preventing obesity. CONCLUSION: LCK11 shows the potential to be used as a novel probiotic for preventing obesity by both promoting PYY secretion to inhibit food intake and regulating gut microbiota.",['10.1002/mnfr.202100136 [doi]'],"['probiotic bound ACE-2 delivery', 'harms', 'SARS-CoV-2']"
8,Gut commensal-derived butyrate reverses obesity-induced social deficits and anxiety-like behaviors via regulation of microglial homeostasis.,"Neuropsychiatric dysfunction and reactive microglia are hallmarks of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, yet whether these reactive microglia contribute to HFD-induced obesity-related behavioral abnormalities and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that HFD feeding causes social deficits and anxiety-like behaviors with impaired neuronal activity and alters the gut microbiota, particularly by depleting Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), in mice. The profiles of microbiome and metabolome in HFD-fed mice predict that specific microbial taxa and their metabolites regulate HFD-induced obesity-related behavioral abnormalities. Oral treatment with the L. reuteri reduces microglial activation and increases dendritic spine density, thus ameliorates social deficits and anxiety in HFD-fed mice. HFD-fed mice that are administered L. reuteri are also found to accumulate butyrate in their gut, sera and brain. Moreover, supplementation of butyrate improves behavioral abnormalities and modulates microglial homeostasis in HFD-fed mice. In addition, selectively removal of microglia through a pharmacologic approach can rescue dendritic spine loss and increase neuronal activity that profoundly alleviates social deficits and anxiety arising from HFD-induced obesity. Overall, this study reveals an unexpected pivotal role of gut commensal-derived butyrate in HFD-induced social deficits and anxiety-like behaviors through regulation of microglial homeostasis and identifies a potential probiotic treatment for HFD-induced obesity-related behavioral abnormalities.","['S0014-2999(21)00491-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2021.174338 [doi]']","['gut virome', 'infuences', 'obesity']"
9,"""More Guts Than Brains?""-The Role of Gut Microbiota in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.","BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension syndrome (IIH) is most common among obese women. Weight loss is an important factor in improving papilledema. Over the last decade, growing evidence has identified gut microbiota as a potential factor in the pathophysiology of obesity. Accordingly, we investigated whether the gut microbiome is modified in IIH patients compared with healthy controls, and provide possible new treatment venues. METHODS: Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome of 25 cases of IIH patients (according to the modified Dandy criteria) and 20 healthy controls. Participants were further stratified according to their body mass index. The total DNA from each sample was extracted using the PureLink Microbiome DNA Purification Kit A29789 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). Library preparation was performed using the Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 device. A list of bacterial species that significantly differed between the IIH patients and healthy controls was produced in addition to species diversity. In addition, patients' cohort alone was analyzed, (excluding the healthy controls), and the effect of acetazolamide treatment on their gut microbiota was analyzed. RESULTS: IIH patients have a lower diversity of bacterial species compared with healthy individuals. These bacteria, that is, Lactobacillus ruminis (L. ruminis) (p<6.95E-08), Atopobium parvulum (p<3.9E-03), Megamonas hypermegale (p<5.61E-03), Ruminococcus gnavus (p<1.29E-02), MEL.A1 (p<3.04E-02), and Streptococcus sp. I-G2 (p<3.04E-02), were previously characterized with beneficial health effects. Moreover, we found that Lactobacillus brevis, a beneficial bacterium as well, is more abundant in acetazolamide treated patients (p<7.07E-06). CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota plays a potential role in IIH etiology and therefore, can provide a promising new treatment approach for this disease.","['10.1097/WNO.0000000000001330 [doi]', '00041327-900000000-98687 [pii]']","['early pubertal', 'causes', 'obesity']"
